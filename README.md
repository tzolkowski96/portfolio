Personal site - writing and work.

## Overview

A simple, focused personal site built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no build process, just clean code and thoughtful content.

## Recent Updates
- December 2024: Redesigned as personal site, removed portfolio elements
- Added JSON feed for syndication
- Currently reading: The Visual Display of Quantitative Information

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main site (all-in-one approach)
- `404.html` - Custom error page for GitHub Pages
- `feed.json` - JSON Feed for syndication
- `og-image.*` - Social sharing assets

## Content Strategy

- **Now page**: Updated monthly with current readings and thinking
- **Writing**: Recent posts with archive links to Medium/Substack
- **Work**: Current role and approach (not a resume)
